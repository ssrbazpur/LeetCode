* Jan 1: Easy: HashMap Use. First Value of arr as key and rest as values
* Jan 2: Easy: Simple Inorder Traversal of two tree. Return node if it is equal to target 
* Jan 3: Medium Tricky: Permutation Algorithm plus one addition check.
* Jan 4: Easy: Make a dummy node and two pointers for both linked list.
* Jan 5: Easy : Make dummy and check if duplication or not. 
* Jan 6: Easy: Make a start=1 and check it in array[i] if not equal decrement k. When k is zero there is the ans.
* Jan 7: Easy Question but tricky with using Pointers.
